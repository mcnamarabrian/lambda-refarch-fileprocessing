# Serverless Reference Architecture: Real-time File Processing

The Real-time File Processing reference architecture is a general-purpose, event-driven, parallel data processing architecture that uses [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda). This architecture is ideal for workloads that need more than one data derivative of an object. 

In this example application, we deliver notes from an interview in Markdown format to S3.  S3 Events are used to trigger multiple processing flows - one to convert and persist Markdown files to HTML and another to detect and persist sentiment.

## Application Components

### Event Trigger

In this architecture, individual files are processed as they arrive. To achive this, we utilize [AWS S3 Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html) and [Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html). When an object is created in S3, an event is emitted to a SNS topic. We deliver our event to 2 seperate [SQS Queues](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), representing 2 different workflows. Refer to [What is Amazon Simple Notification Service?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html) for more information about eligible targets.

### Conversion Workflow

We target a SQS queue for this workflow. Sending the JSON event to SQS first rather than directly to Lambda allows for more control of Lambda invocations and better error handling.

The Lambda service polls our queue on our behalf. When messages are available they will be delivered to our function. Lambda can automatically scale with the number of messages on the queue. Refer to [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html) for more details.

If our Conversion Lambda function fails to process the messages, the function sends the event to a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for inspection. A CloudWatch Alarm is configured to send notification to an email address when there are any messages in the Conversion DLQ.

Our function business logic uses this information to retrieve the file from S3 using the [Python AWS SDK (boto3)](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html?id=docs_gateway) and store it in a temporary location within the function execution environment. The path of the file is then passed to a python function which reads the file contents and converts it to HTML using the Python [Markdown Library](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/). We then generate the filename for the new HTML file and write it to our temporary location. Finally we upload the new HTML file to an output S3 bucket.  If our function execution results in an error, we will 

### Sentiment Analysis Workflow

We are using AWS' AI/ML service [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) which is a machine learning powered service that makes it easy to find insights and relationships in text. We use the Sentiment Analysis API to understand whether interview responses are positive or negative.

The Sentiment workflow uses the same SQS-to-Lambda Function pattern as the Coversion workflow. Our function downloads the markdown file, extracts the contents, and sends it to the Comprehend Sentiment Analysis API. This returns a Sentiment and a confidence score which describes the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of its detection of sentiments.

Once we have our sentiment we persist the result to our [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) table.

If our Sentiment Lambda function fails to process the messages, the function sends the event to a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for inspection. A CloudWatch Alarm is configured to send notification to an email address when there are any messages in the Sentiment DLQ.


## Building and Deploying the Application with the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)

This application is deployed using the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM).  AWS SAM is an open-source framework that enables you to build serverless applications on AWS.  It provides you with a template specification to define your serverless application, and a command line interface (CLI) tool.

### Pre-requisites

* [AWS CLI version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

* [AWS SAM CLI (0.41.0 or higher)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Build

The AWS SAM CLI comes with abstractions for a number of Lambda runtimes to build your dependencies, and copies the source code into staging folders so that everything is ready to be packaged and deployed. The *sam build* command builds any dependencies that your application has, and copies your application source code to folders under *.aws-sam/build* to be zipped and uploaded to Lambda. 

```bash
sam build --use-container
```

**Note**

Be sure to use v0.41.0 of the AWS SAM CLI or newer.  Failure to use the proper version of the AWS SAM CLI will result in a `InvalidDocumentException` exception.  The `EventInvokeConfig` property is not recognized in earlier versions of the AWS SAM CLI.  To confirm your version of AWS SAM, run the command `sam --version`.

### Package

Next, run *sam package*.  This command takes your Lambda handler source code and any third-party dependencies, zips everything, and uploads the zip file to your Amazon S3 bucket. That bucket and file location are then noted in the packaged-template.yaml file. You use the generated packaged-template.yaml file to deploy the application in the next step. 

```bash
sam package \
    --output-template-file packaged-template.yml \
    --s3-bucket bucketname
```

**Note**

For *bucketname* in this command, you need an Amazon S3 bucket that the sam package command can use to store the deployment package. The deployment package is used when you deploy your application in a later step. If you need to create a bucket for this purpose, run the following command to create an Amazon S3 bucket: 

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://bucketname --region region  # Example regions: us-east-1, ap-east-1, eu-central-1, sa-east-1
```

### Deploy

This command deploys your application to the AWS Cloud. It's important that this command explicitly includes both of the following:

  * The AWS Region to deploy to. This Region must match the Region of the Amazon S3 source bucket.

  * The CAPABILITY_IAM parameter, because creating new Lambda functions involves creating new IAM roles.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged-template.yml \
    --stack-name lambda-file-refarch \
    --region region \
    --tags Project=lambda-refarch-fileprocessing \
    --parameter-overrides AlarmRecipientEmailAddress=<your email address> \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

You will receive an email asking you to confirm subscription to the `lambda-file-refarch-AlarmTopic` SNS topic that will receive alerts should either the `ConversionDlq` SQS queue or `SentimentDlq` SQS queue receive messages.


## Testing the Example

After you have created the stack using the CloudFormation template, you can test the system by uploading a Markdown file to the InputBucket that was created in the stack. You can use the *sample-1.md* and *sample-2.md* files in the repository as example files. After the files have been uploaded, you can see the resulting HTML file in the output bucket of your stack and collect the sentiment of each document. The CloudWatch logs for each of the functions will contain details of their execution.

You can use the following commands to copy a sample file from the provided S3 bucket into the input bucket of your stack.

```bash
INPUT_BUCKET=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource --stack-name lambda-file-refarch --logical-resource-id InputBucket --query "StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId" --output text)
aws s3 cp ./sample-1.md s3://${INPUT_BUCKET}/sample-1.md
aws s3 cp ./sample-2.md s3://${INPUT_BUCKET}/sample-2.md
```

Once the input files has been uploaded to the input bucket, a series of events are put into motion.

1. The input Markdown files are converted and stored in a separate S3 bucket.
```
OUTPUT_BUCKET=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource --stack-name lambda-file-refarch --logical-resource-id ConversionTargetBucket --query "StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId" --output text)
aws s3 ls s3://${OUTPUT_BUCKET}
```

2. The input Markdown files are analyzed and their sentiment published to a DynamoDB table.
```
DYNAMO_TABLE=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource --stack-name lambda-file-refarch --logical-resource-id SentimentTable --query "StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId" --output text)
aws dynamodb scan --table-name ${DYNAMO_TABLE} --query "Items[*]"
```

You can also view the CloudWatch logs generated by the Lambda functions.

## Cleaning Up the Example Resources

To remove all resources created by this example, run the following command:

```bash
bash cleanup.sh
```

### What Is Happening in the Script?

Objects are cleared out from the `InputBucket` and `ConversionTargetBucket`.

```bash
for bucket in InputBucket ConversionTargetBucket; do
  echo "Clearing out ${bucket}..."
  BUCKET=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource --stack-name lambda-file-refarch --logical-resource-id ${bucket} --query "StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId" --output text)
  aws s3 rm s3://${BUCKET} --recursive
  echo
done
```

The CloudFormation stack is deleted.

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack \
--stack-name lambda-file-refarch
```

The CloudWatch Logs Groups associated with the Lambda functions are deleted.

```bash
for log_group in $(aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix '/aws/lambda/lambda-file-refarch-' --query "logGroups[*].logGroupName" --output text); do
  echo "Removing log group ${log_group}..."
  aws logs delete-log-group --log-group-name ${log_group}
  echo
done
```
